				<h3>SQL INJECTION: What is it?</h3>
					<p>
						An SQL injection, or insertion, is when a user takes an SQL query and inputs it via the client side application input.  Basically, a user can input a query into a field that the computer prompts the user for.  The two most common SQL injection methods are error-based and blind.  Error-based means that inputs may return errors to the user in which they can determine additional information and vulnerabilities of the database they are trying to access.  Blind means that error messages have been disabled and the user (or automated tool) has to guess what the database is returning and how its responding to the attacks.  
					</p>  
				<h3>PURPOSE: Why do this at all?</h3>
					<p>
						The main purpose of SQL injection is to "hack" a database system to learn or retrieve sensitive information and data. According to owasp.org, this will allow users to  "spoof identity, tamper with existing data, cause repudiation issues such as voiding transactions or changing balances, allow the complete disclosure of all data on the system, destroy the data or make it otherwise unavailable, and become administrators of the database server." These are all very bad things and can open up a company to a variety of liabilities. 
					</p>
				<h3>SAFEGUARDS: What can you do to stop it?</h3>
					<p>
						Below are some basic safeguards to help protect your data from SQL injections:
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>Use Prepared Statements (Parameterized Queries):  This means that the developer will be forced to define all the SQL code and then, later on, pass the parameters to the query.  This allows the database to distinguish between queries (code) and input (user inserted information), regardless of what the user actually supplies. </p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>Stored Procedures:  This is exactly the same as prepared statements with the exception that the defined SQL code is stored directly within the database.  There are pros and cons to doing it this way or the standard prepared statements but it mostly depends on your system and circumstances.  </p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>Escaping All User Supplied Input:  This works by taking the proper DBMS escaping schemes to escape all user supplied input in your particular database.  This will make it so that your DBMS doesn't confuse SQL code with any of the user inputted data and, as a result, avoiding any possible SQL injection threats. </p> 
								<p>Its important to note that this technique is not as strong as using the prepared statements method.  This technique is typically used for legacy programs for cost savings purposes.  Otherwise, you'd have to rewrite all the legacy code to include the parameterized queries.  </p>
							</li>
						</ul>
