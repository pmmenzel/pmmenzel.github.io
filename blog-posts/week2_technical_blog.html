				<h3>Positioning: <strong><em>Overview</em></strong></h3>
					<article>
						<p>So today, I decided to delve into positioning for html elements.  I thought this would be best as I was struggling generally with the subject but I think I have a better grasp on it now. <br/><br/>
						CSS positioning, generally, allows you to position an element on a website. To help with understanding this concept, its always good to think of individual elements as their on box.  From there, you can logically determine how and where you'd like to position those elements relative to the whole page, or within an other element.

				<h3>Positioning: <strong><em>Static</em></strong></h3>
					<article>
						<p>As you may or may not know, all elements are defaulted to the position of static.  This basically means the element is positioned where it would normally be if no stylings were applied to it.  You don't typically have to specify this unless you are trying to override a parent attribute. <br/>
						This may be obvious, but statically positioned elements are not affected by top, bottom, left and right properties. </p>

				<h3>Positioning: <strong><em>Fixed</em></strong></h3>
					<article>
						<p>Elements with a fixed position will always remain in the same place relative to the browser window.  Even if you scroll, the element will still in the fixed location within the browser window (which can be a cool affect if that's what you're going for!).  <br/>
						Its important to remember that fixed elements are removed from the normal flow of the page.  Other elements on the page act as if the fixed element doesn't even exist.  (How ruuude! - full house, anyone..?)</p>

				<h3>Positioning: <strong><em>Absolute</em></strong></h3>
					<article>
						<p>Elements that have an absolute positioning applied are positioned relative to their first parent element that has a position other than <em>position:static</em>.  However, if there is no parent element, then the element can be positioned anywhere on the page using <em>top, bottom, left or right</em>. <br/>
						Similar to fixed elements, absolute elements are removed from the normal flow of the page and other elements act as if the fixed element doesn't even exist. (Again, Ruuude - you should know the reference by now)</p>

				<h3>Positioning: <strong><em>Relative</em></strong></h3>
					<article>
						<p>For relative positioning, you can move elements to a new locations relative to its normal position.  You do this by utilizing the following properties:  <em>top, bottom, left or right</em>.  This is useful in instances, for example, where you want a couple elements to overlap, such as a header overlapping on to an image. <br/>
						Important Note:  elements with a relative position are usually used for containers of absolutely positioned elements.  (Write that down)</p>
