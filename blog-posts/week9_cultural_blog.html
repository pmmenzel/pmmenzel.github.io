					<h3>You Need Help</h3>
					
						<p>
							Typically, when someone asks a question it is due to the fact that they need help or they don't understand something. Though this seems obvious, sometimes this fact can be overlooked and as a result their questions aren't answered completely or at all.  What I mean by this is that you need understand what information you specifically need or want in order to ask an clear, concise and appropriate question.  But I understand that this is easier said than done. 
							</p>
					<h3>Self Reflection</h3>

							<p>
							Once you've come to the conclusion that you need help, you need to start reflecting on what specific information that you need to get the desired result.  This may take just a few moments or it might take several minutes, but time should be taken to figure out what you specifically want to know. 
							</p>
					<h3>Research</h3>
						<p>
								Now that you've taken some time to reflect on your dilemma, you should take some time to research the aspects of the information that you want.  This, too, may take some time and effort but its an important step in finding the appropriate answer.  The reason for this is that while you research, though you may not find a specific answer to your question, you might find additional information that could help you narrow the scope of information that you seek or other useful information that might help you answer different question you might have now or in the future.  Researching various issues is an extremely useful exercise to follow as it always can teach you something that you didn't even know you were looking for. 
						</p>
					<h3>Asking Good Questions</h3>
					<img src="images/questions/questions.png" alt="Asking Questions">
						<p>
								We ask questions for a variety of reasons from programming questions to questions regarding directions.  Sometimes, however, people can tend to ask very vague questions simply because they are frustrated or in a rush.  For example, someone traveling in another country who's been lost for 30 minutes and is very frustrated, might ask where a specific place is on the map.  Though the question identifies useful information that the person wants, they should be more thoughtful and ask a more specific question such as "where am I on this map and where is the [INSERT DESTINATION]?"  Another example, more applicable to programming, might be when you ask, "Why isn't my page working the way I want it to?"  Again, a better and more specific way to ask this question would be to state what you want your HTML page to do, show the code that's supposed to do that but isn't working and and other information that you think is relevant to your inquiry.  Its important to note that you should also be conscience of providing too much information that isn't relevant to your question.  This can be confusing and may not result in the answer that you are looking for. 
						</p>
					<h3>How You Ask The Right Questions</h3>
					
						<p>
								How you ask a question can sometimes be even more important than what specific information you're asking about.  Generally speaking, this will likely be more applicable to work place scenarios in which you have many face to face interactions with people you work with but its still important to know even if you work remotely.  Now, generally what I mean by how you ask is that the form of the question can provide for different answers.  For example, asking, "Did you finish your assignment?" might give you a different answer than, "How's are things going with your assignment?"  This is important because people might respond negatively or defensively to the first question as it seems like they are being interrogated.  The second question provides an avenue to ask for the information you need while maintaining good working relations with your colleague. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Also, though it can be more efficient to ask for a specific answer to your question, its much more valuable if you ask HOW to get your answer.  What I mean by this is instead of saying, "Here's my problem, what's the answer?" you can say, "Here's my problem, do you have any suggestions or resources that could help me figure out the answer?"  In time sensitive situations, this might to be the way to go but, generally, it his highly recommended to ask the question in this way as it gives the person your asking an opportunity to refresh/relearn something and it provides you an avenue to learn AND get the answer you want.  Then, when the time comes that someone asks you a very similar question, you will more than likely be able to help them.  You may not even remember how you got the answer when you initially had a similar question but because you were able to ask a good question, you learned how to get the answer and can now teach someone else.
