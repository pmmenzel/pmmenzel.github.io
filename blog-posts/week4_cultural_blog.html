					The Success or Failure of Advancing Technology:  It's You're Fault Either Way

				<p>
					Now the title of this topic probably seems a bit....blame-y.  But, don't worry, its supposed to be that way.  I mean, in essence, this REALLY IS your fault.  But, its also my fault, your Dad's Fault, your best friend's fault...I mean its everyone's fault, really, including myself.
				</p>
				<p>Let me explain.  </p>
				<p>
					Over the last 20 or 30 years, technology has grown exponetially and that mostly can be attributed to the rise of the internet.  The internet opened the flood gates and the glass ceiling that we were all living under virtually shattered overnight.  In the beggining, everything was so amazing and incredible! For all my fellow Echo Boomers out there you can relate to the notion that IM-ing with 4 different people from all parts of the world was the most amazing thing ever invented since sliced cheese!  That's because at the time, it was.  But now, in hindsight, those types of things were so trivial and what I would consider the first baby steps into the world of technological potential.  Mainly, connection with one another.  </p>
				<p>
					This was the beginning of the end of the world as we knew it.  By this I mean that the world before the internet seemed so vast and daunting.  But after the internet, the world began to shrink in way that no one thought possible.  We started to share information, develop relationships, learn about other people and cultures that we wouldn't know through more conventional means. And this was all instantaeously!  ...Well, after we got past modems, anyway.  Kids today will never appreciate our excitement and frustration with that scratchy sound modems would make just before you connected with the world.  It was like opening an old large secret door that scrapped the ground when you opened it! (I had a vivid imagination as a kid, sue me). </p>
				<p>
					This was all because of the internet.  But then, there was another breakthrough in technology which would change the world again.  Personal Cellular Phones.  Landline phones were pretty amazing by themselves as we were able to talk to someone on the other side of the planet live and instanteously.  But Cellphones allowed us to talk to anyone almost anywhere you are located because you could now bring the phone with you.  But, at no point and time did it ever occur to me that we would combine the two, access to the internet and Cellphones, into once device.  Boom, the world just changed again.  With this advancement, we not only could talk to anyone anywhere at any time, we had an infinite repository of information, literally, at our finger tips.  </p>

				<p>
					Now, that's all good and fun, and its a history that most of the readers here will already know. But what does this have to do with me, you might ask, and how is this my fault.  </p>
				<p>
					One must take into account how we, as consumers, have contributed to the advancement of technology.  You might be thinking to yourself, "huh, I haven't done anything to contribute to the advancment of technology, I just like it!"   But, that's exactly my point.  You like it, a lot.  The world actually can't enough of the "latest and greatest."  We are essentially a large group of addicts and we are constantly demanding a new fix.  Think about it, how excited do you get when its time to get a new smartphone or tablet or computer.  I mean, the entire ecosystem of the tech world is catered towards the consumer.  Phones, computers, apps, you name it, are all typically created with the consumer in mind.  </p>
				<p>
					But, why is this a problem?  The problem is that most of the consumer tech products are bought with discretionary income.  By this I mean, most of the tech that we "need" to have, we don't actually need.  We just want it REALLY badly.  Again, think about it, do you need your smartphone with all your apps, instant access to email, facebook, instagram, etc.  The hard truth (plug your ears...err...cover your eyes...err...skip this part):  No, we do't need it.  Its simply becoming the norm - for most developed countries, anyway.  </p>
				<p>
					The reason this becomes a problem when you rely on consumer discrentionary income is that people's discretionary income relies on healthy economy so consumers have the income to consume.  There are some serious political, economical, socialogical implications because of this.  How does a country's legistlative system favor the middle and lower classes? how do they favor corporations and businesses?  As many of you are aware, there has been much discussion and concern surrounding the shrinking middle class.  If the middle class disappears then you're either on the upper class side or the lower class side - which class will be larger?  My assumption would be the lower class.  But, if the lower class is the largest, will they have any discretionary money to spend on these consumer tech products?  Maybe, maybe not.  </p>
				<p>
					In conclusion, we need to realize that technology is the key to the future in almost every aspect of life.  But, we need to make sure that innovation and technological advancements are protected from the ebbs and flows of the economical and political landscapes.  I think its immature and niave to ignore this because it is all but apparent that technology is here to stay and its going to take us places that we cannot yet even imagine.  </p>

				<p>
					Or, alternatively, we need to ensure that the middle class doesn't disappear so the consumer can continue to fund these innovations.  But, that's more of a political position so I'll leave that up to the individual whether or not that's merrited. </p>
