						It’s become more and more apparent that I can get through various challenges significantly faster when pairing with someone else.   In some cases my other pair isn't as knowledgeable or proficient as I am, in others they can be more knowledgeable or proficient than I am, or we can both be very limited on our knowledgeable depth but are able to research and share ideas which will always expedite the process.    Pairing is not only beneficial from an assignment standpoint but it’s also great to observe how different people process and handle situations differently.  
						</p> 
						<p>
						I’ve learned that some people are better to pair with on particular assignments for a variety of different reasons.  I very much enjoy working with other people, collaborating and sharing ideas.  This is what makes pairing interesting and fun.  But, also, I enjoy the feeling of mulling over a challenge that we are both struggling with and then we suddenly realize what we need to do or what we were doing wrong.  VICOTRY!  That’s what I say in my head …or to my pair depending on how I’m feeling.  
						</p>
						<p>
						What I find difficult and sometimes frustrating, is when you pair with someone who is obviously very knowledgeable but seems to be in a rush or are in some way impatient.  It’s almost as if I’m not moving fast enough.   This causes me to be very flustered and slows me down even more (if that’s what I was doing in the first place).  But I also understand that pairing isn’t just about learning the material, it’s also about learning to work with others in a productive way.  Some people have strong interpersonal skills while others have stronger technical skills and the key is to find a good balance of both.   So, ultimately, I’m thankful for the people that cause me any frustration as it teaches me to further adapt to these situations and better handle myself when these situations arise.  
						</p>
						<p>
						I know that everyone has something they can work on about themselves and I am no exception to the rule.  This is why feedback is such an important aspect of the pairing process.  Though at times, feedback can cause a twinge of discomfort, if you are able to take the criticisms and use them to better yourself, your potential for growth is seemingly unlimited.   This goes back to the whole Growth mindset which I agree with firmly.  The feedback I’ve received so far has been immensely helpful in that it’s given me confidence in myself through words of encouragement or people explaining that they are in similar situations as I am.   I have also received helpful information and tips related to specific shortcomings I have.  
						</p>
						<p>
						For example, I was very hesitant to suggestion things as I felt that I wasn’t particularly confident in my understanding or knowledge of certain syntaxes.  But, through various feedbacks, I learned that there are many people who feel the same way but sharing what I might think is the right answer might very well lead to the right answer even if I was initially wrong.  Another example is when we were first working on CSS material and I was struggling with a concept related to positioning, the feedback I got from a couple people really helped as they pointed me to some alternative resources to help deepen my understanding conceptually as well as practically.   It’s always a work in progress but that was extremely helpful. 
						</p>
						<p>
						In terms of providing feedback, I enjoy this process as well.  To me, this is another opportunity to solidify something that you do have a firm grasp on and translate that information to someone else.   I’m on the fence whether or not I agree with karim’s concept about NOT using the shit sandwich.  I think it depends a lot on the person and the situation.  What I mean by this is generally, I think being straightforward and honest and not necessarily sugar coating things is, in theory, the best way to help someone improve.  But, going back to the shit sandwich, criticism is better received when you provide it in an easily digestible form.   So telling someone that they did x y and z very well but a b and c you need to work on and improve can allow some who might have a more difficult time taking criticism accept that sort of information.  I think this is especially true if you are on a project where you have to work with someone and you depend on their work product to finish the project.   I think it would be a stubborn mentality to just think that they need to suck it up or act mature and accept what I’m saying even if it’s particularly tough for them to hear.    I think that this all plays into one’s emotional intelligence.   Having and developing a strong set of skills to navigate varying personalities.  
						</p>
						<p>
						In conclusion, I think that the pairing-feedback system is definitely a tool to accelerate my learning capabilities.  I never really thought of this before in learning context but I’m glad I’ve been exposed and I think I will always somehow try to use this learning style as a way to help further my knowledge and skill set when I so desire.
