				<h3>What is Rails?</h3>
					<p>
							The short answer: Its a web application development framework which utilizes the Ruby language.
					</p>
					<p>
							More specifically, the Rails is framework is supposed to make developing web applications and programs significantly easier that many other languages.  This is due to the fact that Rails is a very opinionated individual (...err, program).  Rails makes a lot of assumptions about what the developer wants and needs to begin developing a particular application allowing the developer to write less code while accomplishing more than other languages can.  Rails has a suggested "best" practices and its design encourages you to follow it.  It even discourages you from following other alternative practices for syntax.  But, according to the developers who created rails, if you follow their best practices you will likely notice a significant different your productivity levels.  Assuming that you have prior experience. But the most important thing is that many experienced developers have stated that Rails makes web development a lot more FUN!
					</p>
				<h3>Rails: Primary Philosophies</h3>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>
									<strong><em>KEEPING IT DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself:</em></strong>  If you have any experience with programming than you are probably familiar with this concept of not repeating yourself.   More specifically, its suggested by many guides that all information or knowledge in a program should a single representation.  When code is more succinct its much more maintainable, readable and less buggy. 
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<strong><em>WE WANT CONVENTION:</em></strong>  In older languages, it was much more of an industry standard to have numerous configuration files associated with your program or web application which ultimately requires a lot of maintenance.  However, on Rails, there are many preset conventions in that, as I stated before, there are a lot of assumptions that Rails makes during the set up of application project. Why is this good, you ask?  Because not having to update and maintain configuration files regularly cuts down on your development time a noticeable amount.  This means that you can go from the drawing table to distribution much quicker but you can also make appropriate changes and updates much more seamlessly. 
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
					<p>
						Along with the information stated above, Ruby on Rails has many great tools and features that make it standout against the competition. Interactions with HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, etc. make it a fluid software to work with in so many different ways.  With hundreds of thousands of companies and websites that already use Ruby on Rails, including big name companies like amazon, groupon and NASA, its no wonder why ruby has become so popular.  Developers who take up Ruby not only tab into a lush job market, but they also are stepping into a world where easy of use, productivity and efficiency rain supreme.  I'm sure if a developer comes from another language they will be more than happy when they learn Ruby on rails.
