					<h3>VALUES & MY PERCEPTION</h3>
					<p>
						Some of the values that I think might apply to me are Accountability, Courage, Personal development, Integrity, Knowledge, Persistence, family and several others.  
					</p> 
						<p>
						<em>Personal development:</em><br/>
						I felt that upon review the possible values that might be applicable to me, I think that personal development stands out the most.  This is important to me because it has served me well throughout my life and various aspects of my life.  I've always tried to better myself in school, family, relationships, passions (such as sports), work and other personal aspects of my life.  To me, striving to development one's self is something that never stops and you can always work on.  Depending on what your focus is or where you are in life, personal development is something that I am always striving for. 
						</p>
						In terms of living up to the various values I most I identify with, I would rate them as follows:
						<ul>
							<li>Accountability: 5.  I always try to be accountable for my own actions and I strive to do this often.</li>
							<li>Courage: 5.  I've always been thoughtful in my decisions but some decisions, such as going to DBC, takes courage.</li>
							<li>Personal development: 5.  See above. </li>
							<li>Integrity: 4.  This, to me, is very similar to accountability because you have to have integrity and courage to be accountable for your actions</li>
							<li>Knowledge: 3.  This rank is a bit lower because I think my level of knowledge has so much room for improvement.  But its not to say that I am not knowledgeable about a variety of things, I simply think I'm not even close to being satisfied. </li>
							<li>Persistence: 4.  I've always been a persistent person, especially when its something I'm passionate about. </li>
							<li>family: 5.  I come from a large family and many of those values related to my family I always carry with me. </li>
						</ul>
						<p>
						As you can see, I relate to a variety of values and I think this is something that others in my life notice.  I've been one to be asked advice by friends and family alike.  Most recently, I was asked about job searching.  At face value, one might think that this wouldn't really apply to any of the values that I've previously listed.  However, I think taking things in the right context can change that perspective.  For instance, job searching takes a lot of persistence and accountability in that you have to stick with it, keep sending out resumes, do as many interviews as you can, etc.  Job searching also plays into personal development in that an individual trying to change jobs or careers usually stems from wanting more out of their career.  This can be monetary, fulfillment, passion or a countless number of other things.  
						</p>
						
						<h3>VALUES AND STEREOTYPE THREAT:  Fitting The Pieces</h3>
						<p>
						So how can I apply these values in relation to stereotype threat and overcoming it.  To me, this seems obvious.  My values consist of some of the very tools to combat stereotype threat.  For example, when faced with a threat and not many resources to aid you, one must be persistent and have courage in order to succeed.  In situations like this, you must use those feelings of inadequacy and refocus them back to your ultimate goal, which is not always easy.  For me personally, this is what I do when it comes to feelings of personal development.  Coming to DBC was a choice, no one forced me to do it.  I developed an interest, and maybe even a passion, for coding and no one is going to tell me to try harder or to quit.  I'm accountable to myself and no one else at this point and time.  My family and friends support me, of course, and if I failed miserably, they'd still love me.  However, I feel like I have so much more to offer and so much more to grow as a person in my life and in my career.  The reason I left my last job, which was a good one, was I lacked the feeling of personal growth and development.  This all takes courage and I'm willing to accept that challenge.
