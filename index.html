		<h3>About Me</h3>
		<p>Name's Patrick but you can call me Pat, if you'd prefer. I was born in San Deigo but have lived the majority of my life in the Bay Area and have been living in San Francisco for the past 3-4 years. I currently/previously worked in the legal feild as a Paralegal for 7 years but it was never something that I was particularly passionate about. Which is why you now find me here, programming to my hearts content.</p>

		<p>I grew up with a large family of 5 brothers and sisters (including myself), we are all adopted and all ethnically diverse. I went to college at a small college south of San Francisco, Notre Dame De Namur, which I played basketball ball on scholarship during my time there. I graduated with as Business Finance Major.</p>

		<h3>Updates this week</h3>
