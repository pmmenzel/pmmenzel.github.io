			<h2>The Popularity of Javascript</h2>

					There are a multitude of reasons why Javascript is so popular.  To start, its a very easy language to learn, according to many sources around the web.  Javascript also has a plethora of libraries to pull from which can be for almost anything you can think of. Javascript is a fast client-side language which reduces the load on servers.  One last great thing about Javascript is that it allows you to extend functionality to web pages.  For exmaple, using Greesemonkey to enable developers to had little bits of Javascript to which can be executed on a desired web page.

					However, there are some downsides to using Javascript.  First of all, it is notoriously unreliable in cross-browser testing.  This, as you might assume, can make for a very frustrating situation.  Also, Javascript is known for having a variety of security issues.  As I stated above, Javascript allows for snippets of code to be added to a desired web page.  But this ability can be used to exploit the user's own system.  
				</p>
				<p>
					Overall, though there are some noteworthy downsides, I think that Javascript is a language that will be around for a while because of its versatility, easy to learn syntax and it makes web pages that much better.
