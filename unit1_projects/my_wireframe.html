				<p>What I'm trying to accomplish above is to provide a general layout for my personal website.  Up until this point, I only viewed my index site as a means of quickly accessing all my various projects in an efficient manner.  However, this is quickly becoming impractical as we continue to add more and more projects to our index pages.    </p> 
				<p> So, doing a general outline (or wireframe, if you will) of the website and where you generally want to things to layout is the first step.  For my wireframe layout, I decided to have links at the top for each unit which will lead to another website for each unit and provide all the various projects.  I think when I create those, I will also include screen shots of my project pages to give people an idea of where they'll be navigating to.  Then, I wanted to have a sidebar with my picture and some social media links to had a professional yet personal feel to the website.  Next, I would provide general summary describing myself, my background and, perhaps, my aspirations.  Lastly, I would provide a footer with some generic information such as my email address as well as a link to DBC in case people were interested.  </p>
