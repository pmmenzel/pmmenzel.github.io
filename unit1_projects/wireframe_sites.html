				<h4>BUZZFEED.COM</h4>
				<img width="500px" src="http://i.imgur.com/Jiaqb9u.png" alt="Buzzfeed">
				<p align="left">Buzzfeed is a content heavy website.  The moment you first get to the open page you are bombarded with articles, news and other related content.  I think this particular website is trying to solve the problem of getting a taste of all trending news without having to read an extensive amount.  The ultimate problem with this though is that you run into a feeling of clutter and too much information.  This might more heavily rely on the subjective view of the user because this is something tha I like about it.  </p>

			<h4>IMGUR.COM</h4>
			<img width="500px" src="http://i.imgur.com/WfPToQG.png" alt="Imgur">
			<p align="left">Imgur is a website of user submitted and user driven content.  Unlike many websites they are allowing the users to determine the content that will predominately be shown.  So utlimately, the website serves to show you what images, and other content, is important, interesting or just a hot topic of any particular day.  Its a very simple website so at first glance it doesn't seem like much and almost seems to be lacking any substantive design.  However, I believe this is intentional in order for the users to focus on content not the design.</p>

			<h4>BBC.COM</h4>
			<img width="500px" src="http://i.imgur.com/alF7QAi.png" alt="BBC">
			<p align="left">The BBC is attempts (and succeeds) in providing its users a wide range of information for a variety of topics.  Its design allows the user to easily navigate to articles based on topic, region, etc.  It also provide trending topics or major events front and center when you first arrive at the website.  I think visually, the site is generally well designed but sometimes it can be difficult to find an area of interest because the titles can be a bit to subtle in comparison to the entire scheme of the website. </p>
