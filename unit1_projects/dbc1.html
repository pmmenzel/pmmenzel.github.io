	<h6 class="headers">Why You're Here</h6>
		<p>I've technology and computers as long as I<br/> could remember.  Never thought I'd ever<br/> be able to learn how to program because <br/>there were alot of misconcepts that I had.<br/>  Now, on my path to becoming a bonefide <br/>coder, I couldn't be more excited.  <br/>Learning so much already but so much more to learn.  Lets do this!</p>
