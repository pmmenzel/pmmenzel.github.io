			<h2>~ The EB and FLOW of DBC ~</h2>
			<div class="text">
				<p>
					I think DBC isn't going to be like any learning experience I've ever encountered before.  The etiquette, culture and demeanor of DBC is an intense learning environment.  However, I believe that it will place you in the best possible position to ultimately start a career in programming. I think DBC can be a very intimidating place at first.  But if you muster the courage to dive into something that you may know very little about with an open mind, it could very well change your life.  For me personally, I'm nervous as hell.   Just like what Shereef was talking about, those fears are real but you just have to control those fears and work your ass off!  <br/><br/>
					I think this type of learning environment is going to get me exactly where I want to be in just a few months.  I really like how deeply engaged with our going to be with each other, the staff and the coder community.  I enjoy working with others but even in these early stages I've already learned so much about myself.  For example, though I love working with others, sometimes I need to take some time to myself to reflect or time to work on something without the distraction of trying to process what a peer might have to say about it.  <br/>
<br/>
					I'm learning more and more everyday about the process, what to expect and, of course, programming.  I'm immensely excited about the prospect of this great opportunity and I can't wait for Phase 1 to begin!  But first I have to get through Phase 0.
