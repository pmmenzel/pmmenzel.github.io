					I am an Abstract Sequential thinker and have an Aural and Kinesthetic learning style.  
				</p> 
				<p>
					As an Abstract Sequential thinker, there are many ways that I can take advantage of this thinking style during my time at DBC.  First of all, according to my research, it appears that I have strong analytical skils, and very idea oriented and verbal.  I honestly do see how this wouldn't be advantageous at DBC.  Particularly in relation to the verbal aspect.  I know that I don't have a problem voice concerns about any questions or concerns I might have and from my experience so far in Phase 0, this has definitely been a benefit to my personal development.  This also tends to be the thinking style of leader types.  In my experience, leaders know not only when to lead but when to follow and listen.  This has already been a huge advantage in the learning process.  
				</p>
				<p>
					In considering my experience thus far in Phase 0, I have definitely struggled with a number of concepts and lessons.  I personally think that this can be contributed by my learning style, Aural Kinesthetic.  As I am working full time in a demanding job and typically have little time to really delve into any one lesson or topic, this causes some shortcomings in my retention of the materials.  The Kinesthetic aspect of my learning style really play into this as I need to take time to test things out, type them myself and then receive feedback to fix or solidfy concepts.  I think that moving forward it might be very beneficial to do my best to work through the materials in a timely manner and complete the minimum requirements.  Then, I would hope, this would provide additional time to re-review the materials and research additional resources to assist in truly understanding the context/content.  I could then go back and really add some more substance to my work assignments which would again, solidify my understanding of the materials.   
				</p>
				<p>
					Now, even with an idea for a strategy to optimize my learning and thinking styles, I know I need to keep an open mind about how I learn.  We've throughly gone over materials describing why we need to have a growth mindset and this would be no exception.  I think something I can do to continue this mindset is to really pay attention to how others learn and strategies that they employ.  I can then try to mold those strategies and learning styles to my own situation.  It won't be perfect or even work all the time.  But giving it a try might enlighten me about a new way in which I can learn effectively.
